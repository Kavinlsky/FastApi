# FastApi Company Registration

This is the Project of Company Registraion with Fast API.

First, we need to register a company with basic information such as name, address, pan, aadhar and password

 After that, we need to Login with our registered Credentials.
 
 Once logged in, We can see the chat screen. If we  click on "Text Box" button then type a Message and clicks the Send Button

 The User's asks question it will pass through into the AI Model such as Open AI and Gemini AI and Get the response.

And we can clear the chat history, Edit the Company Profile Data and Update, Delete the Profile. 

In this FastAPI project, I will use the MongoDB for database operation. If you want to run it locally then please install



Note -  I don't have a Open AI API Key Access, Alternatively I can use the Gemini AI for  generating responses.
